My name is Jacob Martinez.
Although I currently live in San Angelo Texas, I was born and raised in San Antonio, Tx. I am married and have a 2 year old boy with one more on the way! I like to play the drums and any sport. My wife and I play on co-ed volleyball leagues for fun.

My favorite book is the Bible. Now my favorite book in the Bible is Proverbs.
